This is a small mod that changes the stats of some pickaxes and drills, consisting almost entirely of buffs.
The most major changes are:
* Buffing silver, tungsten, and gold pickaxes, and compensation buffs to later pre-hardmode pickaxes
* Buffs to drills to make surpassing them with pickaxe mining speed buffs slightly harder
